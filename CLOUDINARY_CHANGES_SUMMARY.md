}
```

### Single Upload - After (Cloudinary):
```javascript
response.data = {
  message: "File uploaded successfully",
  file: {
    url: "https://res.cloudinary.com/.../image.jpg",
    publicId: "opdrape/products/12345-67890",
    filename: "12345-67890",
    originalname: "product.jpg",
    mimetype: "image/jpeg",
    size: 123456,
    cloudinaryData: {
      width: 1920,
      height: 1080,
      format: "jpg",
      // ... more metadata
    }
  }
}
```

## Validation Rules

### File Size
- **Maximum**: 10MB per file
- **Error**: "File is too large. Maximum size is 10MB"

### File Types
- **Allowed**: JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG
- **Error**: "Invalid file type. Only JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG allowed"

## Upload Types/Folders

| Type | Cloudinary Folder | Usage |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| `products` | `opdrape/products` | Product images |
| `users` | `opdrape/users` | User profile pictures |
| `reviews` | `opdrape/reviews` | Review images |
| `categories` | `opdrape/categories` | Category images |

## Backward Compatibility

✅ The system accepts both URL formats:
- Old local URLs: `/uploads/products/12345.jpg`
- New Cloudinary URLs: `https://res.cloudinary.com/.../12345.jpg`

✅ No database migration needed - URLs are still stored as strings

## Testing Checklist

## What to Test Manually

1. **Single Upload**:
   - [ ] Upload image < 10MB
   - [ ] Try uploading image > 10MB (should fail)
   - [ ] Try uploading non-image file (should fail)
   - [ ] Verify image displays from Cloudinary URL

2. **Multiple Upload**:
   - [ ] Upload multiple images at once
   - [ ] Verify all images appear from Cloudinary

3. **Error Handling**:
   - [ ] Test with backend offline (should show fallback warning)
   - [ ] Test with invalid file type
   - [ ] Test with oversized file

4. **User Experience**:
   - [ ] Check toast notifications appear
   - [ ] Verify error messages are clear
   - [ ] Confirm success messages show

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Image Deletion UI
Consider adding a delete button to remove images:
```javascript
import { deleteImage } from '../../services/api';

const handleDeleteImage = async (publicId) => {
  try {
    await deleteImage(publicId);
    // Remove from state
    toast.success('Image deleted');
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error('Failed to delete image');
  }
};
```

### Upload Progress Bar
Add real-time upload progress:
```javascript
const response = await axios.post('/api/uploads/products', formData, {
  onUploadProgress: (progressEvent) => {
    const percentCompleted = Math.round(
      (progressEvent.loaded * 100) / progressEvent.total
    );
    setUploadProgress(percentCompleted);
  }
});
```

### Image Transformation Examples
Use Cloudinary URL transformations:
```javascript
// Thumbnail (200x200, cropped)
const thumbnailUrl = imageUrl.replace('/upload/', '/upload/w_200,h_200,c_fill/');

// Optimized (auto format, auto quality)
const optimizedUrl = imageUrl.replace('/upload/', '/upload/f_auto,q_auto/');

// Responsive (width 800, maintain aspect ratio)
const responsiveUrl = imageUrl.replace('/upload/', '/upload/w_800,c_scale/');
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Uploads fail with "401 Unauthorized"
**Solution**: Check backend JWT token is valid

### Issue: "Fallback mode" warning appears
**Solution**: 
- Verify backend is running
- Check backend Cloudinary credentials in `.env`
- Test backend endpoint directly

### Issue: Images don't display
**Solution**: 
- Check Cloudinary URL in browser
- Verify Cloudinary account is active
- Check browser console for CORS errors

## Console Logging

The updated code provides clear console logs:

### Success:
```
✅ Upload successful to Cloudinary: { url: "...", publicId: "...", size: 123456 }
✅ Image deleted successfully from Cloudinary
```

### Warnings:
```
⚠️ All Cloudinary upload endpoints failed: [error]
⚠️ Using client-side data URL fallback
```

### Errors:
```
❌ Failed to delete image from Cloudinary: [error]
```

## Dependencies

No new dependencies added! All changes use existing packages:
- ✅ `axios` (already installed)
- ✅ `react-toastify` (already installed)
- ✅ `FormData` (browser native)

## Performance Impact

### Improvements:
- ✅ Images served from Cloudinary CDN (faster)
- ✅ Reduced server bandwidth usage
- ✅ Automatic image optimization
- ✅ Client-side validation prevents unnecessary uploads

### Considerations:
- ⚠️ Initial upload may take slightly longer (going to cloud)
- ⚠️ 30-60 second timeouts set for large uploads
- ✅ Overall user experience improved with CDN delivery

## Security

- ✅ JWT authentication required for all uploads
- ✅ File type validation on client and server
- ✅ File size limits enforced
- ✅ Cloudinary provides DDoS protection
- ✅ Images stored securely in Cloudinary cloud
